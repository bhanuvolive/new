                       <p>Sehati for Information Technology Services L.L.C. was established in 2014 with a single unifying vision: To transform the healthcare landscape in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia by utilizing state-of-the-art technology to enhance the standard and quality of health services. In line with the Saudi Vision 2030, Sehati’s mission is to deliver the Saudi Health Insurance Bus (SHIB) Project and the Saudi e-Health Record (SeHE) Platform to the Saudi government. These two healthcare initiatives will be a universally integrated platform called “UniPlat” and it will be the first of its kind ever to be introduced and implemented in the Middle East. </p>
                       <p>In collaboration with the Council of Cooperative Health Insurance (CCHI) and under the auspices of the Ministry of Health, Sehati will build and operate the UniPlat, an innovative national E-Health program for digital transformation of all healthcare related services in the Kingdom for achieving full transparency in all healthcare transactions, increasing efficiency and reliability for healthcare providers and insurance companies, and ultimately providing the citizens and residents of Saudi Arabia with an enhanced healthcare experience.</p>
